            Neither the markets nor aid alone can solve the problems of poverty.
            More than two billion people around the world lack access to basic
            goods and services—from clean water and electricity to an education
            and the freedom to participate in the economy. We’re here to change
            that. Our vision is a world based on dignity, where every human
            being has the same opportunity. Rather than giving philanthropy
            away, we invest it in companies and change makers.

            Acumen was incorporated on April 1, 2001, with seed capital from the
            Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco Systems Foundation and three
            individual philanthropists. Our desire was to transform the world of
            philanthropy by looking at all human beings as members of a single,
            global community where everyone had the opportunity to build a life
            of dignity. The organization would invest “Patient Capital,” capital
            that bridges the gap between the efficiency and scale of
            market-based approaches and the social impact of pure philanthropy,
            in entrepreneurs bringing sustainable solutions to big problems of
            poverty. cocididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
